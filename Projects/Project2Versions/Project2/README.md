# Project 2: Denature

  A quiet, lonely, soft and cold world appears before you...

  I wanted to create a small pocket dimension of beautifully simple particles.
Rather than make an ecosystem of a dog eat dog sort, I find a gentle float of
peaceful circles to be much more interesting.
  The user experience on needs to use the mouse to interact. I wanted everything
to feel very small and delicate. Since the beginning, I wanted the mouse to be
a brush that the user could use to probe-out particles' nature, but not the sole
interaction.
  I had a lot of difficulty trying to get the particles to react to each other. It
was by far my most frustrating and difficult challenge because I couldn't get it
to work.
  With what I knew how to do, I tried my best to make the coolest thing I could.
The "Puffer" particle truly represents what I was trying to make. As I ran into
difficulties I created other particles, the "Bubbler" and "Dazzler" to complete
a piece of the picture I originally envisioned.
